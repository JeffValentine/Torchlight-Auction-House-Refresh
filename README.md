## 💡 What is it?

A standalone **HTML + JavaScript widget** that:

- ⏰ Tracks real-time with updates synced to every 10-minute auction house cycle  
- 🔔 Plays a custom sound warning before the next refresh  
- 🎧 Sound works while browser is in the background  
- 💾 Remembers your settings (sound, volume, warning time)  
- ⚠️ Warns you not to minimize (instead drag/tab out to avoid pause)  
- 🌈 Animated UI with glow effects and warning pulses  
- 📼 Includes a **1x1px silent video** trick to keep the tab from sleeping

- Runs on a **second screen**
